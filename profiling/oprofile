You might be able to force oprofile to use the timer mechanism in the
virtualized environment. Running a short script like this as root:

#!/bin/sh
#
# Short script force timer mode
opcontrol --deinit
/sbin/modprobe oprofile timer=1
opcontrol --init

This script will force oprofile to use the timer fallback mechanism rather than
attempting to use the hardware performance counters. Then you should be able
collect time based samples using it.
