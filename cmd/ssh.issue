Every time I reinstall my system I have to add the line below to my /etc/ssh/ssh_config to avoid ¡°Write failed: Broken pipe¡± issue.
ServerAliveInterval 120
It's matter of personal preference, but I use these values:
ClientAliveInterval 15
ClientAliveCountMax 3


on host A:
ssh-keygen -t rsa
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh lyang0@pek-lpgtest1.wrs.com 'cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys'
