+What:	cgroup option updates via remount, and "name=" mount option
+When:	March 2013
+Why:	Remount currently allows changing bound subsystems and
+	release_agent.  Rebinding is hardly useful as it only works
+	when the hierarchy is empty and release_agent itself should be
+	replaced with conventional fsnotify.  "name=" option allows
+	mounting existing hierarchy by its name, which isn't useful
+	and has been broken for years without anyone noticing.
