Run build and boot test with standard kernel (preempt-rt and tiny kernel will be covered by other stories) on all qemu BSPs:
- qemux86-64
- qemux86
- qemuarm
- qemuarma9
- qemuarm64
- qemuppc
- qemumips
- qemumips64

We need support multiple image types for some BSPs, i.e. qemuarma9 needs support both zImage (for qemu) and uImage (for Simics).
