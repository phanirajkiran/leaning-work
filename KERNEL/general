man syscall:

NAME
       syscall - indirect system call

SYNOPSIS
       #define _GNU_SOURCE         /* See feature_test_macros(7) */
       #include <unistd.h>
       #include <sys/syscall.h>   /* For SYS_xxx definitions */

       int syscall(int number, ...);

DESCRIPTION
       syscall() is a small library function that invokes the system call whose assembly language interface has the specified number with the specified arguments.  Employing syscall() is useful, for example, when invok‚Äê
       ing a system call that has no wrapper function in the C library.

       syscall() saves CPU registers before making the system call, restores the registers upon return from the system call, and stores any error code returned by the system call in errno(3) if an error occurs.

       Symbolic constants for system call numbers can be found in the header file <sys/syscall.h>.
