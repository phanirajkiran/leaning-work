:
Unless you have a server release of some years ago (red hat and centos 5.X for example), you should have a kernel able to use Cgroups, in general check if your kernel is >= of 2.6.24 with the command uname -a this is the requisite to use cgroups.

Than you need the tools in user-space, i’m doing the tests on my Ubuntu, on this idistribution the files to be installed are cgroup-bin and libcgroup1 :

sudo aptitude install cgroup-bin libcgroup1

Once installed you’ll have a new filesystem mounted:

# ls /sys/fs/cgroup
cpu  cpuacct  devices  memory

On other Linux distributions you could need to mount it manually with a command like :

#sudo mount -t cgroup none /mnt
