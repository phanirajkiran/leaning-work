<p>
            Based on the generated list of providers and the dependency information, 
            BitBake can now calculate exactly what tasks it needs to run and in what 
            order it needs to run them. 
            The build now starts with BitBake forking off threads up to the limit set in the 
            <code class="filename"><a class="link" href="ref-variables-glos.html#var-BB_NUMBER_THREADS" title="BB_NUMBER_THREADS">BB_NUMBER_THREADS</a></code> variable.
            BitBake continues to fork threads as long as there are tasks ready to run,
            those tasks have all their dependencies met, and the thread threshold has not been 
            exceeded.
        </p>
<p>
            It is worth noting that you can greatly speed up the build time by properly setting 
            the <code class="filename">BB_NUMBER_THREADS</code> variable.  
            See the
            "<a class="link" href="../yocto-project-qs/building-image.html" target="_self">Building an Image</a>"
            section in the Yocto Project Quick Start for more information.
        </p>
<p>
            As each task completes, a timestamp is written to the directory specified by the 
            <code class="filename"><a class="link" href="ref-variables-glos.html#var-STAMP" title="STAMP">STAMP</a></code> variable (usually
            <code class="filename">build/tmp/stamps/*/</code>). 
            On subsequent runs, BitBake looks at the <code class="filename">/build/tmp/stamps</code>
            directory and does not rerun
            tasks that are already completed unless a timestamp is found to be invalid. 
            Currently, invalid timestamps are only considered on a per 
            <code class="filename">.bb</code> file basis.
            So, for example, if the configure stamp has a timestamp greater than the 
            compile timestamp for a given target, then the compile task would rerun.
            Running the compile task again, however, has no effect on other providers 
            that depend on that target. 
            This behavior could change or become configurable in future versions of BitBake.

            Some tasks are marked as "nostamp" tasks.
            No timestamp file is created when these tasks are run.
            Consequently, "nostamp" tasks are always rerun.
