        The packaging classes add support for generating packages from a build's
        output. 
        The core generic functionality is in <code class="filename">package.bbclass</code>.
        The code specific to particular package types is contained in various sub-classes such as
        <code class="filename">package_deb.bbclass</code>, <code class="filename">package_ipk.bbclass</code>,
        and <code class="filename">package_rpm.bbclass</code>. 
        Most users will want one or more of these classes.
    </p>
<p>
        You can control the list of resulting package formats by using the 
        <code class="filename"><a class="link" href="ref-variables-glos.html#var-PACKAGE_CLASSES" title="PACKAGE_CLASSES">PACKAGE_CLASSES</a></code> 
        variable defined in the <code class="filename">local.conf</code> configuration file, 
        which is located in the <code class="filename">conf</code> folder of the 
        <a class="link" href="../dev-manual/source-directory.html" target="_self">Source Directory</a>. 
        When defining the variable, you can specify one or more package types.
        Since images are generated from packages, a packaging class is 
        needed to enable image generation.
        The first class listed in this variable is used for image generation.

        The package class you choose can affect build-time performance and has space
        ramifications.
        In general, building a package with RPM takes about thirty percent more time as 
        compared to using IPK to build the same or similar package.
        This comparison takes into account a complete build of the package with all 
        dependencies previously built.
        The reason for this discrepancy is because the RPM package manager creates and 
        processes more metadata than the IPK package manager.
        Consequently, you might consider setting <code class="filename">PACKAGE_CLASSES</code>
        to "package_ipk" if you are building smaller systems.
    </p>
<p>
        Keep in mind, however, that RPM starts to provide more abilities than IPK due to 
        the fact that it processes more metadata.
        For example, this information includes individual file types, file checksum generation
        and evaluation on install, sparse file support, conflict detection and resolution
        for multilib systems, ACID style upgrade, and repackaging abilities for rollbacks.
    </p>
<p>
        Another consideration for packages built using the RPM package manager is space.
        For smaller systems, the extra space used for the Berkley Database and the amount 
        of metadata can affect your ability to do on-device upgrades.
