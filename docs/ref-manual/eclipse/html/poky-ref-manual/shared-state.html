<p>
            Checksums and dependencies, as discussed in the previous section, solve half the 
            problem.
            The other part of the problem is being able to use checksum information during the build
            and being able to reuse or rebuild specific components.
        </p>
<p>
            The shared state class (<code class="filename">sstate.bbclass</code>) 
            is a relatively generic implementation of how to "capture" a snapshot of a given task. 
            The idea is that the build process does not care about the source of a task's output.
            Output could be freshly built or it could be downloaded and unpacked from
            somewhere - the build process doesn't need to worry about its source.
        </p>
<p>
            There are two types of output, one is just about creating a directory
            in <code class="filename">WORKDIR</code>.
            A good example is the output of either <code class="filename">do_install</code> or 
            <code class="filename">do_package</code>. 
            The other type of output occurs when a set of data is merged into a shared directory 
            tree such as the sysroot.
        </p>
<p>
            The Yocto Project team has tried to keep the details of the implementation hidden in 
            <code class="filename">sstate.bbclass</code>. 
            From a user's perspective, adding shared state wrapping to a task
            is as simple as this <code class="filename">do_deploy</code> example taken from 
            <code class="filename">do_deploy.bbclass</code>:
            </p>
<pre class="literallayout">
     DEPLOYDIR = "${WORKDIR}/deploy-${PN}"
     SSTATETASKS += "do_deploy"
     do_deploy[sstate-name] = "deploy"
     do_deploy[sstate-inputdirs] = "${DEPLOYDIR}"
     do_deploy[sstate-outputdirs] = "${DEPLOY_DIR_IMAGE}"

     python do_deploy_setscene () {
         sstate_setscene(d)
     }
     addtask do_deploy_setscene
            </pre>
<p>
            In the example, we add some extra flags to the task, a name field ("deploy"), an
            input directory where the task sends data, and the output
            directory where the data from the task should eventually be copied. 
            We also add a <code class="filename">_setscene</code> variant of the task and add the task
            name to the <code class="filename">SSTATETASKS</code> list.
        </p>
<p>
            If you have a directory whose contents you need to preserve, you can do this with 
            a line like the following:
            </p>
<pre class="literallayout">
     do_package[sstate-plaindirs] = "${PKGD} ${PKGDEST}"
            </pre>
<p>
            This method, as well as the following example, also works for multiple directories.
            </p>
<pre class="literallayout">
     do_package[sstate-inputdirs] = "${PKGDESTWORK} ${SHLIBSWORKDIR}"
     do_package[sstate-outputdirs] = "${PKGDATA_DIR} ${SHLIBSDIR}"
     do_package[sstate-lockfile] = "${PACKAGELOCK}"
            </pre>
<p>
            These methods also include the ability to take a lockfile when manipulating
            shared state directory structures since some cases are sensitive to file
            additions or removals.
        </p>
<p>
            Behind the scenes, the shared state code works by looking in 
            <a class="link" href="ref-variables-glos.html#var-SSTATE_DIR" title="SSTATE_DIR"><code class="filename">SSTATE_DIR</code></a> and  
            <a class="link" href="ref-variables-glos.html#var-SSTATE_MIRRORS" title="SSTATE_MIRRORS"><code class="filename">SSTATE_MIRRORS</code></a>
            for shared state files. 
            Here is an example:
            </p>
<pre class="literallayout">
     SSTATE_MIRRORS ?= "\
     file://.* http://someserver.tld/share/sstate/PATH \n \
     file://.* file:///some/local/dir/sstate/PATH"
            </pre>
<p>
            </p>
<div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
<h3 class="title">Note</h3> 
                The shared state directory (<code class="filename">SSTATE_DIR</code>) is 
                organized into two-character subdirectories, where the subdirectory 
                names are based on the first two characters of the hash.
                If the shared state directory structure for a mirror has the 
                same structure as <code class="filename">SSTATE_DIR</code>, you must
                specify "PATH" as part of the URI to enable the build system
                to map to the appropriate subdirectory.
            </div>
<p>
        </p>
<p>
            The shared state package validity can be detected just by looking at the
            filename since the filename contains the task checksum (or signature) as
            described earlier in this section. 
            If a valid shared state package is found, the build process downloads it 
            and uses it to accelerate the task.
        </p>
<p>
            The build processes uses the <code class="filename">*_setscene</code> tasks
            for the task acceleration phase.
            BitBake goes through this phase before the main execution code and tries
            to accelerate any tasks for which it can find shared state packages. 
            If a shared state package for a task is available, the shared state
            package is used.
            This means the task and any tasks on which it is dependent are not 
            executed.
        </p>
<p>
            As a real world example, the aim is when building an IPK-based image,
            only the <code class="filename">do_package_write_ipk</code> tasks would have their 
            shared state packages fetched and extracted. 
            Since the sysroot is not used, it would never get extracted. 
            This is another reason why a task-based approach is preferred over a 
            recipe-based approach, which would have to install the output from every task.
