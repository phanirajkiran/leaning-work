            When determining what parts of the system need to be built, BitBake 
            uses a per-task basis and does not use a per-recipe basis.
            You might wonder why using a per-task basis is preferred over a per-recipe basis.
            To help explain, consider having the IPK packaging backend enabled and then switching to DEB. 
            In this case, <code class="filename">do_install</code> and <code class="filename">do_package</code>
            output are still valid.
            However, with a per-recipe approach, the build would not include the 
            <code class="filename">.deb</code> files.        
            Consequently, you would have to invalidate the whole build and rerun it. 
            Rerunning everything is not the best situation.
            Also in this case, the core must be "taught" much about specific tasks. 
            This methodology does not scale well and does not allow users to easily add new tasks 
            in layers or as external recipes without touching the packaged-staging core.
