        A build's quality can be influenced by many things.
        For example, if you upgrade a recipe to use a new version of an upstream software 
        package or you experiment with some new configuration options, subtle changes
        can occur that you might not detect until later. 
        Consider the case where your recipe is using a newer version of an upstream package.
        In this case, a new version of a piece of software might introduce an optional 
        dependency on another library, which is auto-detected.
        If that library has already been built when the software is building, 
        then the software will link to the built library and that library will be pulled 
        into your image along with the new software even if you did not want the 
        library.

        The <code class="filename">buildhistory</code> class exists to help you maintain
        the quality of your build output.
        You can use the class to highlight unexpected and possibly unwanted 
        changes in the build output.
        When you enable build history it records information about the contents of 
        each package and image and then commits that information to a local Git 
        repository where you can examine the information.
