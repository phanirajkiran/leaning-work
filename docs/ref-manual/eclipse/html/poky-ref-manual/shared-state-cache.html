        By design, the OpenEmbedded build system builds everything from scratch unless 
        BitBake can determine that parts don't need to be rebuilt.
        Fundamentally, building from scratch is attractive as it means all parts are 
        built fresh and there is no possibility of stale data causing problems. 
        When developers hit problems, they typically default back to building from scratch
        so they know the state of things from the start.
    </p>
<p>  
        Building an image from scratch is both an advantage and a disadvantage to the process. 
        As mentioned in the previous paragraph, building from scratch ensures that 
        everything is current and starts from a known state.
        However, building from scratch also takes much longer as it generally means 
        rebuilding things that don't necessarily need rebuilt.

        The Yocto Project implements shared state code that supports incremental builds.
        The implementation of the shared state code answers the following questions that
        were fundamental roadblocks within the OpenEmbedded incremental build support system:
        </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
<li class="listitem">What pieces of the system have changed and what pieces have not changed?</li>
<li class="listitem">How are changed pieces of software removed and replaced?</li>
<li class="listitem">How are pre-built components that don't need to be rebuilt from scratch
                used when they are available?</li>
</ul></div>
<p>
    </p>

        For the first question, the build system detects changes in the "inputs" to a given task by 
        creating a checksum (or signature) of the task's inputs. 
        If the checksum changes, the system assumes the inputs have changed and the task needs to be 
        rerun.
        For the second question, the shared state (sstate) code tracks which tasks add which output
        to the build process. 
        This means the output from a given task can be removed, upgraded or otherwise manipulated.
        The third question is partly addressed by the solution for the second question
        assuming the build system can fetch the sstate objects from remote locations and 
        install them if they are deemed to be valid.
    </p>

        The rest of this section goes into detail about the overall incremental build
        architecture, the checksums (signatures), shared state, and some tips and tricks.
