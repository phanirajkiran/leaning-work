        x32 is a new processor-specific Application Binary Interface (psABI) for x86_64. 
        An ABI defines the calling conventions between functions in a processing environment.  
        The interface determines what registers are used and what the sizes are for various C data types.

<p>
        Some processing environments prefer using 32-bit applications even when running 
        on Intel 64-bit platforms. 
        Consider the i386 psABI, which is a very old 32-bit ABI for Intel 64-bit platforms.
        The i386 psABI does not provide efficient use and access of the Intel 64-bit processor resources,
        leaving the system underutilized. 
        Now consider the x86_64 psABI.
        This ABI is newer and uses 64-bits for data sizes and program pointers.
        The extra bits increase the footprint size of the programs, libraries, 
        and also increases the memory and file system size requirements.
        Executing under the x32 psABI enables user programs to utilize CPU and system resources 
        more efficiently while keeping the memory footprint of the applications low.
        Extra bits are used for registers but not for addressing mechanisms.
