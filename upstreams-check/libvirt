    virsh-domain: Refactor cmdVcpucount and fix output on inactive domains
    
    This patch factors out the vCPU count retrieval including fallback means
    into vshCPUCountCollect() and removes the duplicated code to retrieve
    individual counts.
    
    The --current flag (this flag is assumed by default) now works also with
    --maximum or --active without the need to explicitly specify the state
    of the domain that is requested.
    
    This patch also fixes the output of "virsh vcpucount domain" on inactive
    domains:
    
    Before:
    $ virsh vcpucount domain
    maximum      config         4
    error: Requested operation is not valid: domain is not running
    current      config         4
    error: Requested operation is not valid: domain is not running
    
    After:
    $virsh vcpucount domain
    maximum      config         4
    current      config         4

    Add a test suite for cgroups functionality
    
    Some aspects of the cgroups setup / detection code are quite subtle
    and easy to break. It would greatly benefit from unit testing, but
    this is difficult because the test suite won't have privileges to
    play around with cgroups. The solution is to use monkey patching
    via LD_PRELOAD to override the fopen, open, mkdir, access functions
    to redirect access of cgroups files to some magic stubs in the
    test suite.
    
    Using this we provide custom content for the /proc/cgroup and
    /proc/self/mounts files which report a fixed cgroup setup. We
    then override open/mkdir/access so that access to the cgroups
    filesystem gets commit c772feb06941f91cf19f564413f9c15156f7ac80

    Disable static libraries by default
    
    Every source file is currently built twice by libtool, once for
    the shared library and once for the static library. Static libs
    are not commonly packaged by distros and slow down compilation
    time by more than 50% compared to a shared-only build time.
    
    Time for 'make -j 4':
    
          shared only: 2 mins  9 secs
      shared + static: 3 mins 26 secs
    
    Time for non-parallel make
    
          shared only: 3 mins 32 secs
      shared + static: 5 mins 41 secs
    
    Those few people who really want them, can pass --enable-static
    to configure
    
    Disabling them by default requires use of LT_INIT, but for
    compat with RHEL5 we can't rely on that. So we conditionally
    use LT_INIT, but fallback to AM_PROG_LIBTOOL if not present.

    qemu: Allow migration over IPv6
    
    Allow migration over IPv6 by listening on [::] instead of 0.0.0.0
    when QEMU supports it (QEMU_CAPS_IPV6_MIGRATION) and there is
    at least one v6 address configured on the system.
    
    Use virURIParse in qemuMigrationPrepareDirect to allow parsing
    IPv6 addresses, which would cause an 'incorrect :port' error
    message before.
    
    Move setting of migrateFrom from qemuMigrationPrepare{Direct,Tunnel}
    after domain XML parsing, since we need the QEMU binary path from it
    to get its capabilities.

    virsh: Add a helper to parse cpulist
    
    The 'virsh vcpupin' and 'virsh emulatorpin' commands use the same
    code to parse the cpulist. This patch abstracts the same code as
    a helper. Along with various code style fixes, and error improvement
    (only error "Physical CPU %d doesn't exist" if the specified CPU
    exceed the range, no "cpulist: Invalid format", see the following
    for an example of the error prior to this patch).

    qemu: add support for libiscsi
    
    libiscsi provides a userspace iSCSI initiator.
    
    The main advantage over the kernel initiator is that it is very
    easy to provide different initiator names for VMs on the same host.
    Thus libiscsi supports usage of persistent reservations in the VM,
    which otherwise would only be possible with NPIV.
    
    libiscsi uses "iscsi" as the scheme, not "iscsi+tcp".  We can change
    this in the tests (while remaining backwards-compatible manner, because
    QEMU uses TCP as the default transport for both Gluster and NBD).

    qemu: add dtb option support
    
    The "dtb" option sets the filename for the device tree.
    If without this option support, "-dtb file" will be converted into
    <qemu:commandline> in domain XML file.
    For example, '-dtb /media/ram/test.dtb' will be converted into
      <qemu:commandline>
        <qemu:arg value='-dtb'/>
        <qemu:arg value='/media/ram/test.dtb'/>
      </qemu:commandline>
    
    This is not very friendly.
    This patchset add special <dtb> tag like <kernel> and <initrd>
    which is easier for user to write domain XML file.
      <os>
        <type arch='ppc' machine='ppce500v2'>hvm</type>
        <kernel>/media/ram/uImage</kernel>
