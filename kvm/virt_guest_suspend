From inside the guest, initiating suspend and hibernate should succeed. For a Fedora guest, this will be the command line utils

 pm-suspend
 pm-hibernate

The guest should then appear as running (or shutoff? I need to confirm). XXX: how to we wake up the guest

To initiate a suspend from the host on a VM, you can do:

 virsh dompmsuspend --target mem

For hibernate, do

 virsh dompmsuspend --target disk
