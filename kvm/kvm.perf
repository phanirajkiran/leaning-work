[PATCH v8 0/3] KVM: perf: kvm events analysis tool

[PATCH V3] perf & kvm: Enhance perf to collect KVM guest os statistics from host side

 As of Linux 3.3 KVM supports perf counters in the guest. You also need a recent enough Qemu (as of April 2012 that means a git snapshot). Aggregate counts are supported, although overflow interrupts don't seem to be.
