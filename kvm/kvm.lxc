If you want to handle untrusted packages, you'll need LXC or full virtualisation. LXC takes some configuration, but can be handled by libvirt if you want a high level of isolation; you still need to debootstrap it yourself as I recall. For full virtualisation, vmbuilder has a debian version that prepares and configures images. Since you don't need the flexibility of LXC, I recommend pbuilder or vmbuilder + kvm.
