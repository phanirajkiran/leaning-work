    Dockerfile:  FROM ubuntu  (or fedora, centos, ...)   -OR-

    docker run -i -t ubuntu  (or fedora, centos, ...)


Dockerfiles allow you to start from a base image (which is a good thing).  However, those base images are often very large:

    ubuntu: 193 MB
    centos: 236 MB
    fedora: 374 MB
    phusion/baseimage: 437 MB



try to run the container with an image version:

sudo docker run -i -t ubuntu:14.04 /bin/bash

or

sudo docker run -i -t ubuntu:latest /bin/bash
