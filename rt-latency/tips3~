Check that the patch has been correctly applied:
●
●
Running “ps” on the device will show that IRQs are
threaded
Use cyclictest to check the scheduling latency under load
→ The non-RT kernel fails right away under high IRQ
pressure
→ Latencies remain bounded with RT


Set appropriate priorities for your threads
● Any SCHED_FIFO thread is higher priority than any
SCHED_OTHER thread
