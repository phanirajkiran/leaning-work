I've ran into something similar, for me the problem was this line:

from pymongo.objectid import ObjectId

The call seems to work in versions of PyMongo < 2.2

In pymongo 2.2 the call to import objectid is:

from bson.objectid import ObjectId

could not connect to localhost:27017: [Errno 111] Connection refused


Removing mongod.lock from

/var/lib/mongodb

And then restarting the service should do it. For example, in my ubuntu restarting the server is something like:

sudo service mongodb start
